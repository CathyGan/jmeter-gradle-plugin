##Attribution
This project started as a hard fork of [kulya/jmeter-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/kulya/jmeter-gradle-plugin). Besides defect fixes and feature enhancements, most of the original codebase has been re-written since. 

If you are a user of the older plugin see [here]() for easy migration to this version of the plugin. If you're a developer familiar with the older plugin, see [here]() for notes about major changes.
